# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Robotics with VEX

## Grade Level
Grades 5-8

## Duration
60 minutes

## Learning Objectives
- Students will understand basic robotics components (motors, sensors, brain)
- Students will program simple robot movements using VEXcode
- Students will demonstrate problem-solving through robot navigation

## Materials Needed
- VEX IQ or VEX V5 robot kits (1 per group of 2-3 students)
- Computers with VEXcode installed
- Obstacle course materials (cones, boxes)
- Whiteboard/markers for instructions

## Key Concepts
- Input/Output devices
- Sequence programming
- Basic mechanics (gears, wheels)
- Sensor feedback

## Lesson Structure

### Introduction (10 minutes)
- Discuss real-world applications of robotics
- Introduce VEX platform components
- Safety rules and proper handling

### Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
- Demonstrate motor control programming
- Show sensor integration examples
- Explain basic programming concepts (sequences, loops)

### Guided Practice (20 minutes)
- Students build simple robot configuration
- Program basic movements (forward, turn, stop)
- Test programs and debug issues

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
- Students create obstacle navigation program
- Implement sensor-based decision making
- Document their code and observations

### Closure (5 minutes)
- Class discussion: What worked? What challenges?
- Preview next lesson topics
- Clean up and store equipment

## Assessment
- Observation of programming skills
- Completion of navigation challenge
- Code documentation quality

## Differentiation
- Advanced students: Add complex sensor logic
- Struggling students: Provide code templates
- Visual learners: Use block coding instead of text

## Extensions
- Integrate ICT: Add data logging to track robot performance
- Competition: Time trials for obstacle course completion

## Standards Alignment
- NGSS: Engineering Design (MS-ETS1)
- ISTE: Computational Thinking (1c, 4a)
