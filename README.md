# Robotics and ICT Teaching Portfolio: VEX and Abacus Robotics

This project showcases educational robotics and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) teaching materials, designed to demonstrate competencies for a robotics and ICT teacher position.

## Project Focus

- **VEX Robotics**: Comprehensive examples and teaching resources for VEX platforms (IQ, V5, etc.) including coding, mechanics, and competitions.
- **Abacus Robotics**: Resources and program structures inspired by Abacus Robotics' mentor-based STEM learning approach.
- **ICT Integration**: Demonstrations of technology integration in robotics education, including data handling, connectivity, and programming.

## Structure

- `vex_examples/`: Sample code and projects for VEX robotics platforms
- `abacus_resources/`: Information and program outlines based on Abacus Robotics
- `teaching_materials/`: Lesson plans, tutorials, and educational resources
- `ict_integrations/`: ICT-focused demos and integrations
- `docs/`: Additional documentation
- `src/`: Core source code
- `tests/`: Testing and validation scripts

## Getting Started

1. Explore the `teaching_materials/` folder for lesson plans
2. Review code examples in `vex_examples/`
3. Check ICT integrations for technology demos
4. Read `docs/portfolio_summary.md` for detailed project overview

## Setup Requirements

### For VEX Robotics
- VEXcode software (download from vexrobotics.com)
- Compatible VEX robot kit (IQ, V5, or EXP)
- Computer with USB connectivity

### For ICT Demos
